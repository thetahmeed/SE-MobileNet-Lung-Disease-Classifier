Our study used the “COVID19, Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray PA Dataset”
released by Asraf et al. [1], which includes 4,575 posteroanterior (PA) chest X-
ray images categorized into 1,525 COVID-19 cases, 1,525 pneumonia cases, and
1,525 normal cases. The COVID-19 images were sourced from various repositories
including GitHub [2], Radiopaedia, TCIA [3], SIRM [4], and supplemented by 912
augmented images from Mendeley [5]. Images of pneumonia and normal cases were
obtained from the Kaggle repository [6] and the NIH dataset [7]. A balanced and
diverse dataset is essential for effectively training deep learning models, as it helps
the model generalize better across different cases. However, the integration of data
from various sources introduced challenges in processing the images.
